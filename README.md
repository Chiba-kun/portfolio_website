## Technology Stack & Architecture
This portfolio website is a testament to modern front-end web development, built upon a solid foundation of core web technologies:

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the semantic content of the portfolio.
*   **CSS3:** Utilized for styling, responsiveness, and creating a visually appealing aesthetic across the site.
*   **JavaScript:** Powers the dynamic elements, interactivity, and custom logic, including integrations with libraries like `particles.js` for animated backgrounds.
*   **JSON:** Used as a lightweight data interchange format for managing and rendering project details (`projects/projects.json`) and skill sets (`skills.json`), making content updates straightforward.

The architecture is a **client-side rendered static application**, meaning all content and logic are executed directly in the user's browser, providing fast load times and a secure, server-less deployment model.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture & Database Schema
This project is a static web application, primarily client-side rendered, and does not utilize a traditional backend database. Its architecture focuses on the efficient delivery and dynamic presentation of content within the browser.
